Claude Shannon was an American computer scientist, engineer and mathematician. The ideas in his published papers helped jumpstart the fields of information theory and digital communications, paving the way for all the networks of electronic communications around the world that we rely on to make the Digital Age possible.
After he graduated, Shannon went on to perform his graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He had the opportunity to work alongside one of the most prolific computer experts of the time, Dr. Vannevar Bush. The computers they worked with were simple analog calculating machines Bush called “differential analyzers.” Shannon helped Bush program differential equations on these machines, which specialized in solving calculus problems via a complex system of gears, shafts and wheels.
